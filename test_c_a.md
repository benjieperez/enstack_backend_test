## ❓ Question
Assuming that the device is sending continuously at 16000Hz for the X,Y, and Z acceleration measurements, what would your strategy be in handling and processing the data? How would you design the server infrastructure? Please enumerate the steps, software, algorithms, and services that you would use to ensure that the servers can handle the incoming data from our users. Diagrams can be really helpful for this

## 🔄 Data Flow Breakdown

### 1. Clients → WebSocket Server

- Devices connect via **WebSocket** for low-latency, persistent communication.
- Each incoming data packet is:
  - **Validated** for correctness.
  - **Acknowledged** immediately to ensure delivery guarantees.

---

### 2. WebSocket → Redis

- Validated data is **published to Redis Pub/Sub channels**.
- Channels are logically partitioned by:
  - **Device type**
  - **Geographical region**
- This enables:
  - Horizontal scalability
  - Fine-grained control over message distribution

---

### 3. Redis → Elasticsearch

- A **consumer service** listens to Redis channels.
- Responsibilities:
  - Processes and transforms the incoming stream.
  - Indexes the data into **Elasticsearch** using **time-based indices**, e.g.:
    ```
    accelerometer-2025-04-29
    ```
- Advantages:
  - Enables **fast search**
  - Real-time **analytics and visualization**

---

### 4. Redis → MongoDB

- Another consumer stores the raw data into **MongoDB**.
- Benefits:
  - **Flexible schema** allows inclusion of metadata (e.g., user ID, device version).
  - Suitable for **batch processing**, **data backup**, and **long-term storage**.
  - Supports downstream systems like reporting, machine learning, or audit logs.

## 🧩 Summary

| Stage                    | Purpose                                | Technology     |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------|
| Clients → WebSocket      | Real-time ingestion                    | WebSocket      |
| WebSocket → Redis        | Message distribution                   | Redis Pub/Sub  |
| Redis → Elasticsearch    | Fast search & analytics                | Elasticsearch  |
| Redis → MongoDB          | Long-term storage & processing         | MongoDB        |

## 📝 Notes

- This system can be scaled by:
  - Adding more WebSocket instances.
  - Partitioning Redis channels further.
  - Using Elasticsearch sharding and MongoDB replica sets.
